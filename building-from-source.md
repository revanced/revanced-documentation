# Building from source

Before continuing you need to be authenticated to GitHub Packages. 

 This will assume you have a GitHub account. Create a PAT with the scope ```read:packages``` here and add your token to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties. 
  
  Example ```gradle.properties``` file:

```
gpr.user = YourUsername
gpr.key = ghp_longrandomkey
```
